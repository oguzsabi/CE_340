--> 1- If you type 1 and enter an ip address PenTest 2000 will take the ip
    address up to the last dot. (Ex: 192.168.1.). Afterwards it will scan
    for the last 256 ips and record the online hosts into the "icmp.dat"
    file.

--> 2- If you type 2 and enter a single port or a port range PenTest 2000
    will start scanning your desired port(s) of the online hosts you found
    from first operation (alive hosts of icmp.dat file). (Ports are from
    1 to 65535)

--> 3- If you type 3 and enter a single port or a port range or type all
    PenTest 2000 will scan only the open ports in that range for the hosts
    that are alive in the ports.dat file. (Ports are from 1 to 65535)

--> 4- If you type 4 and PenTest 2000 will start OS Fingerprint scanning
    for the hosts that are alive in the open_ports.dat file.

--> 5- If you type 5 and enter a correct url (www.bing.com) or (bing.com)
    the result will show you how many hops away that host is. This method
    will not proceed if an ip is passed. However the one below will print
    the result of the ip as well.

--> 6- If you type 6 and enter a correct url (www.bing.com) or (bing.com)
    the result will show you how many hops away that host is. However this
    is different than the one above because this has a low chance of
    getting stuck during the process. But the output is a bit more complex.
    A note is added at the start and end of the output to help you judge
    the result.

--> 7- If you type 7 and select the custom url option or the 10 random
    website option the program will start to scan those web servers.
    The result will print all the protocols and open ports of that or those
    web servers.

--> 8- If you type 8 the program will check the hosts inside the icmp.dat
    file and for the still online ones it will do an snmp scan (ports 161
    and 162) and record and print the results.

--> 9- If you type 9 you will have to specify the victim ip and
    transportation protocols and also the port or port range the attack
    will start. While the attack is happening tcpdump will monitor those
    packet sent. However if the tcpdump does not reach the specific packet
    count it will automatically stop after 60 seconds. This also means that
    tcpdump monitoring will, at max, run for 60 seconds and then will end.
    You can end the process with 'Ctrl + C' combination whenever you want

--> 10- If you type 10 and enter a correct ip or ip range and specify
    correct protocol(s) and specify a correct port or correct port
    range then the program will start monitoring according to your
    specifications. You can also choose if the ports and hosts will
    be sources, destinations or hosts (both src and dst)

--> 11- If you type 11 you will see 6 options to select from. These
    options will help to print the files you want. If you enter a
    correct value the corresponding file or files will be printed
    on the terminal
